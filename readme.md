# Social Media Analytics and Machine Learning Platform

This project is designed to provide comprehensive analytics and machine learning insights based on social media data from platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. It utilizes Docker to ensure reproducibility and consistency across different environments.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Scripts to load data from various sources into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Analysis**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for performing detailed data analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Training and prediction models to forecast trends and analyze user behavior.
- **Visualization**: Integration with Metabase for data visualization and dashboards.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine to build and run the containers. Visit [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

# Build and run the Docker containers
docker-compose up --build
This command builds the images if they do not exist and starts the containers.

# Usage
Access Jupyter Notebook: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888 to access the Jupyter notebooks.
View Metabase Dashboards: Go to http://localhost:3000 to access Metabase and visualize the data.
Interact with PostgreSQL: The PostgreSQL database is accessible on localhost:5432.

# Directory Structure
/app: Contains the Dockerfile for the Python environment and the Jupyter notebooks.
/data: Directory for database dumps and other data files.
/db: Contains the Dockerfile for setting up the PostgreSQL database.
